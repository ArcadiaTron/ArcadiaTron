_____________
ArcadiaTron is a token created to help with privacy when dealing with the Tron Network as well as being used for transactions, fundraisers, betting and other transactions.

Tron is not anonymous. All transactions are kept in a public ledger and your IP address can even be tied to Tron. If you want to hide your spending habits and how much Tron you control, it is recommended to always mix or blend your Tron with a TRX Blender.  Currently anyone can be tracked when doing transactions in the Tron Network.  For privacy and security reasons, people need to have an option to evade hackers and thieves that have infiltrated someone's online account or wallet with the purpose of tracking and stealing their Tron coins.

  * ArcadiaTron tokens can be used to pay for blender services, payments, betting, online games and a myriad of other uses.
